JDK 1.8 sample programs

What is functional programming:

) In precised way, functional programming is declarative and expression based.
) It tells what to be done rather than how to be done.
) It uses funtions e,g Function/Supplier/Consumer instead of statements e,g if,else,for.
) It supports immutability meaning it doesnt allow to change the state of a variable ,variables are effectively
 final or final once initialized cant be change later the expression context.
 But in imperative programing language like C/C++/Java, inside a methos we can change the value of an already initialized instance variable.
) It is useful in parallel processing.

can be unterstood by the example application FunctionalVsImperativeProgram.java
